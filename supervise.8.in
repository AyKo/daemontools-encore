.TH supervise 8
.SH NAME
supervise \- starts and monitors a service.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B supervise
.I s
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B supervise
switches to the directory named
.I s
and starts the service there by executing first
.B ./start
(if it is executable), and then
.BR ./run .
It restarts
.B ./run
if
.B ./start
or
.B ./run
exit with any value other than 100.
It pauses for a second after starting
.BR ./run ,
so that it does not loop
too quickly if
.B ./run
exits immediately.
All processes are run in a new process group.

If the file
.IB s /down
exists,
.B supervise
does not start the service immediately. You can use
.BR svc (8)
to start the service and to give other commands to
.BR supervise .

.B supervise
maintains status information in a binary format inside the directory
.IR s\fB/supervise ,
which must be writable to
.BR supervise .
The status information can be read by
.BR svstat (8).

.B supervise
may exit immediately after startup if it cannot find the files it needs in
.I s
or if another copy of
.B supervise
is already running in
.IR s .
Once
.B supervise
is successfully running, it will not exit unless it is killed or specifically
asked to exit. You can use
.BR svok (8)
to check whether
.B supervise
is successfully running. You can use
.BR svscan (8)
to reliably start a collection of
.B supervise
processes. 
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B SUPERVISEDIR
If set, the named directory is used instead of
.B @SUPERVISEDIR@
for the status information and control files.  If
.B $SUPERVISEDIR
is an absolute path, it is suffixed with the path to
.I s
with all slashes ("/") replaced with colons (":").
